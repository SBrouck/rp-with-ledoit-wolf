Figure 1 — Simulated annualized Sharpe:
Annualized Sharpe under a common covariance-uncertainty model. Vertical lines mark P5, P50, and P95. Covariance is perturbed via shrinkage-to-diagonal (alpha), volatility scaling (s), and correlation dampening (rho). Latin Hypercube; fixed seed. Metric defined as k/σ_p with k = 0.25% monthly risk premium (3% annual).

Figure 2 — Sharpe vs Robustness frontier:
Mean annualized Sharpe vs robustness, where robustness is the standard deviation of the simulated metric under the same uncertainty. All strategies share the same long-only bounds, weight cap, turnover and cost model. ±SD shown under each point. Risk parity check: largest deviation from equal risk contributions is 7.8% for robust portfolio, 4.6% for ERC.

Figure 3 — Out-of-sample drawdowns:
Monthly drawdowns for each strategy over 36-month out-of-sample period. Drawdown calculated as (NAV - Peak) / Peak. Based on realized excess returns net of transaction costs.
